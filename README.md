# Awesome photos from Flickr

This project is my very first attempt to build a image viewer using JavaScript and related frameworks with Flickr API.

### Technology stack
In this project, I use:

 * AngularJS
 * Boostrap
 * Flickr API
 * Blueimp gallery


### Features
Fortunately, the app can do something for you:
 
 *  Pull and display public photos from Flickr initially 
```
flickr.photos.getRecent
Returns a list of the latest public photos uploaded to flickr.
```
 * Seaching based on text input
```
flickr.photos.search
Return a list of photos matching some criteria. Only photos visible to the calling user
which title, description or tags contain the text will be returned.

```
 * Display each photo in a lightbox when you click on individual one. If you click on the 
 photo again, you can see the title and the effect created by Blueimp (it's very nice you
 should try it)  

Happy coding! :)
